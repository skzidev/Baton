<h1 align="center">Baton</h1>

<h3 align="center">A Python interpreter written in Batch</h3>

What's the point?

- It's Open Source and Written in Batch
- It's Simple to use
- It's Extensible
- It's Light-Weight

<h2 align="center">Notice</h2>

Baton isn't Complete, It is still **Extremely Unifinished** and will most likely lack some functionality of CPython.

<h3 align="center">Setup</h3>

- Download the Files Or download the installer in the "Setup" Folder
- Run it.
